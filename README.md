# ACC Chroma App

Currently Razer only!

This is a piece of software that will make your keyboard react to flags in ACC.

Requires Razer Synapse and Razer Chroma Connect module.

# How to use:

Download: https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/acc-chroma.43300/

Put this somewhere safe, doesn't matter where.

Launch the app together with the game. 

Enjoy!

In order to close it, it is recommended to use ctrl+C instead of the X button.

# Current functionality:

Respectively reacts to:

Blue flag, global yellow flag, white flag, green flag, orange flag, checkered flag

The app also reacts to the pit limiter.

# What I am doing currently:

Currently I am transfering everything to the OpenRGB platform so that the app works for all main manufacturers.

# What's on my list with things to do:

Add different pit limiter styles.

Add option to switch mode for different keyboard sizes. (If the issue I have in mind isn't resolved by OpenRGB) 

# Changelog:

Version 1.3: Removed single-sector yellow flag as it is too distracting. Added support for Razer mice, mouse docks and mousepads. (The last two are not guaranteed to work, but I will not spend much time fixing them as I want to switch to the OpenRGB platform)

Version 1.2.2: Important bug fix

Version 1.2.1: Minor bug fix

Version 1.2: MAJOR UPDATE: Should completely fix any issues with the app working on different computers. Adds per-sector yellow flag. Adds pit limiter effect.

Version 1.1.0: MAJOR ERROR FIX (No changes in code)

Version 1.0: Added checkered flag, added penalty flag, improved orange flag.
